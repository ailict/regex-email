# Validating an Email with Regex

This tutorial will walk explain the regex functionality to validate an email address using the expression: 

`/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`

For an overview of all regex components here's a handy [cheatsheet](https://medium.com/factory-mind/regex-tutorial-a-simple-cheatsheet-by-examples-649dc1c3f285). 


## Summary

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Regular expressions are extremely useful in extracting information from any text by searching for one or more matches of a specific search pattern, and are commonly used to find or replace characters within a string or validate inputs. This tutortial will walk through the components of a regex using a common regex that validates email addresses.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The anchor `^` searches for any string starting with what follows the anchor, in the case of the email validator regex, that would be any string that begins with `([a-z0-9_\.-]+)`. Our regex also ends with a common anchor `$` which matches any string ending in what precedes that anchor, in this case `([a-z\.]{2,6})`.

The entire expression is surrounded by two backslashes, which we'll get to when we discuss flags, but are indicated by `/(regex)/` and potentially a letter outside of the backslash; when evaluating a regex, the anchors will be inside of the backslash characters.

### Quantifiers

This regex uses the `+` quantifier, which indicates that the first part of the string must be followed by 1 or more of what immediately precedes the `+`. In our expression, this quantifies at least 1 or more characters of `[a-z0-9_\.-]` before the `@` and `.`; this is standard email format of "character @ somewebsite . domain". 

The domain is specifically quanfied with the curly brackets of `{2,6}`, which further defines that the  preceding character set `[a-z\.]` will be between two to six characters only.

### OR Operator

OR operators are employed through the use of square brackets in the expression that indicate the place of any one character for which we're unsure what we're searching. For our email, this means the first part can be looking for any, at least one, character `a-z0-9_\.-` which is followed by @ and searching for any character `\da-z\.-`, followed by a period, searching for any character `a-z\.` only two to six times.

### Character Classes

`\d` is used to match a single character that is a digit 0-9. Used within the OR operator, it is merely providing that one of the characters in the second part of an email between the `@` and `.` could possibly be a single digit.

### Flags

A regex usually comes within two backslash characters, and at the end we can specify a flag outside of these characters. There are no flags on this email validator regex.
